# Evolving Strings with Genetic Algorithm

This project aims to implement Hill Climber to evolve a given target string: "Hi. My name is Samuel Makanjuola, and this is a simple demonstration of Genetic Algorithm. Thanks!!!!". The target string consists of 100 characters, making it a challenging search-based problem. Feel free to make appropriate changes as needed, such as modifying the target string or adjusting the Hill Climbing parameters, to suit your requirements.

## Tasks

1. **Hill Climber Implementation**:
   The implementation includes the following components:

   - Initialization of the current solution.
   - Iterative exploration of neighboring solutions.
   - Evaluation of solution fitness using a fitness function.
   - Selection of the best neighboring solution to improve upon the current state.
   - Termination criteria when no better solution can be found.

2. **Performance Evaluation**: Hill Climbing, Genetic algorithm, and Random Search will be compare based on their performance. This comparison helps assess each algorithm's effectiveness in finding the target string within a reasonable time frame.
