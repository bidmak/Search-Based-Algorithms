# Evolving Strings Problem

This project aims to implement GA, Hill climbing, and Random search algorithm to evolve a given target string: "Hi. My name is Samuel Makanjuola, and this is a simple demonstration of Genetic Algorithm. Thanks!!!!". The target string consists of 100 characters, making it a challenging search-based problem. Feel free to make appropriate changes as needed, such as modifying the target string or adjusting the GA parameters, to suit your requirements.

## GA Results

After 51 iterations, the GA successfully evolved the target string:

- **Fitness Score**: 100/100
- **Time Taken**: 60.89 seconds

## Hill Climbing Results

After 745 iterations, Hill climber successfully evolved the target string:

- **Fitness Score**: 100/100
- **Time Taken**: 16.17 seconds

## Random Search Results

Random Search failed to evolve the target string:

- **Highest Fitness Score**: 9/100
- **Termination set time**: 2 minutes
