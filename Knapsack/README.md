# Knapsack

This project aims to implement Genetic Algorithm on a Knapsack task.

## Task

Suppose you are going to spend a month in the wilderness. You're taking a backpack with you, however, the maximum weight it can carry is 20 kilograms. You have a number of survival items available, each with its own number of survival points. Your objective is to maximize the number of survival points within the weight constraints of the backpack.

| Item         | Points | Weight |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Pocketknife  | 10     | 1      |
| Beans        | 17     | 5      |
| Potatoes     | 15     | 10     |
| Water        | 5      | 1      |
| Sleeping Bag | 30     | 7      |
| Rope         | 10     | 5      |
| Compass      | 30     | 1      |
