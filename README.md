# Search Based Software Engineering Projects

The aim of this project is to apply some AI-based approaches, such as search based algorithms and machine learning, in solving some challenging problems associated with software engineering. The primary search-based AI focused upon is Genetic Algorithm. Hill climbing and Random search will also be worked on.
